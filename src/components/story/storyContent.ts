    chapter: "A Vision is Born",
    content: "Port-au-Prince was a city of both hope and hardship. I was one of the lucky ones—Plante Lavi covered my tuition, rent, and living expenses. But outside my small apartment, I saw a different reality: students struggling to afford education, businesses barely surviving, and talented people with no platform to showcase their skills.\n\nI kept asking myself—why didn't we have a digital space designed for us?\n\nIt wasn't that we lacked talent or ideas. We lacked the infrastructure.\n\nIf no one was going to build it for us, I had to do it myself.\n\nBut the city had other plans for me.",

They weren't just worried about careers—they were struggling to survive.\n\nMany couldn't afford to go to university. Some had already given up on education entirely.\n\nIt hit me hard.\n\nI realized how privileged I was to have even had a chance at higher education. I had endured hardships, but at least I had a way out—most didn't.\n\nThis gave me a new dream.\n\nI had to build something bigger than just a business.\n\nI had to create a foundation to help those in need.\n\nBecause I knew what it was to suffer in Haiti.\n\nAnd I knew that without help, many of them would never get the opportunities they deserved.",

I poured everything into the platform, ignoring my health, my social life—everything.\n\nAt times, I had no money left for food. I was struggling so much that I had to beg for survival. It was humiliating, but I had no choice.\n\nI hated it. But I refused to quit.\n\nAnd then, the first breakthrough happened.",
